The plugin registers your copyright with Numly and returns the Numly Number (ESN), barcode,
and verification links to your blog post automatically.

== Description ==
numly Numbers was born from a very old plugin called wp-numly which was originally called wp-esbn that was
coded by Cal Evans. But over the years his plugin stopped working and he no longer worked on it. I took the
old plugin and chopped out what wasnâ€™t needed and fixed what was broken which gave birth to numly Numbers.

Electronic Standard Number (numly) is the unique identifier of electronic content and media. numlys are
recognized worldwide by electronic publishing companies and electronic content providers. They serve as branded
identifier or copyright for individuals or companies developing electronic content and media. numlys are
assigned and managed by <a href="http://www.numly.com">numly.com</a>.

The plugin registers your copyright with Numly and returns the Numly Number (electronic serial number), barcode,
and verification links to your blog post automatically.

I hope you enjoy numly numbers as much as I do.
